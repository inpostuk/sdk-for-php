InPost has a national network of nearly 1,200 fully automated parcel lockers that are accessible 24/7, meaning no more queues or waiting in, enabling customers to collect, send and return parcels at their earliest convenience. All lockers are located in a variety of safe and secure locations including Morrisons supermarkets, Esso petrol stations and Transport for London sites, as well as outside retailers such as Toys R Us.

This Software Development Kit implements InPost Locker services in PHP programming language and essentially is a wrapper around API V4 https://github.com/inpostuk/docs/blob/master/InPost_API_V4.pdf with additional helpful functions on top.

The library is self documented within source code comments, to get started see sample sequence of methods in index.php.
